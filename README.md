# BARCODE-PRINTER
UPC and EAN barcode printer

**Barcode Printer**	

Here is a very simple program written in GW-BASIC and also
designed to run in QBASIC to display the barcode image.  If you are running
this program in QBASIC you will get better resolution.  But you have to
change SCREEN 2 to SCREEN 11 in LINE NO 290.


                While you are running the program , the program asks you to
enter the Number.  You have to keyin 12 digits only.  The Check Sum will be
automatically generated and displayed by the program.
